            <p>
                I'm Aaron Schanzenbach, a Full Stack Developer new to the coding world; however I believe by combining my previous work experience with my newfound knowledge I have a lot to offer!
                I and my family reside in northern Wyoming, where I recently graduated from a Full-Stack Developer bootcamp.
                I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies and I am always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges and technologies.

                Please take a look at some of my projects, learn a little more about me, and contact me if you have any questions or opportunities!
            </p>
